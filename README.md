Assignment 18: Text Vectorization Techniques


Description
-----------
This assignment focuses on implementing and comparing core text vectorization techniques used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The objective is to convert textual data into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models, while focusing only on feature extraction methods.

The following techniques are implemented:
1. One-Hot Encoding (Manual and Scikit-learn)
2. Bag of Words (BoW)
3. N-gram Vectorization (Unigrams, Bigrams, Trigrams, Combined N-grams)
4. TF-IDF Vectorization
5. Vectorizer Parameter Exploration



Dataset
-------
SMS Spam Collection Dataset
